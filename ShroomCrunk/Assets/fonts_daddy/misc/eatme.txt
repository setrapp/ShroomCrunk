          shrooms

12.18.97  to celebrate the release of the festive disturbed.com version 2.0, i present you with a dingbat font, shrooms.  this font was originally just a couple of illustrations for nate at shroomy.com, but i drew lots and lots, and voila:  a font.  

redistribution of this font is prohibited.  this font is mine, not yours.  don't give it away.  only i can give it away.  if you want to give it away, ask me first, and i will say no.
